# CSC311 Project
This is the project for CSC311 Fall2022 (Introduction to Machine Learning), taught by Rahul Krishnan and Alice Gao. <br />
It is build on code provided https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/courses/csc311_f22/index.html#project.

In this project, we implemented various machine learning algorithms to predict students' correctness of a given diagnostic question. <br />
In part A, we explored three different approaches for our project, namely **KNN, IRT (Item Response Theory)**, and **Neural Networks**. Additionally, we implemented an **ensemble** method for IRT to enhance the stability and accuracy of our base model. <br />
In part B, we extended the IRT algorithm to further improve its accuracy and rigorously tested its performance.<br />

All code can be found in `/starter_code`. <br />
Results and analysis are in `final_report.pdf`.
